### International Reception

- The game *Who's at the Door?* received widespread acclaim, achieving a **91% user rating on Steam**.
- It was praised by popular streamers and YouTubers, with comments like:  
  > *"I can’t believe a game like this came out of Korea."*  
  > *"Terrifying and incredibly fun."*  
  > *"Captures Korean-style horror perfectly."*

### Design Philosophy

- Inspired by the “Exit 8”-like genre, the game uses a **“spot the difference” mechanic** in ordinary, realistic environments.
- It adds **strong storytelling and horror presentation**, creating a highly immersive psychological experience.

> Originally planned as a VR game, it retains **immersive mechanics** from that format—such as inspecting objects up close—translated into PC gameplay.

---

### Subverting Player Expectations

- The developer **reverses genre norms**: players are encouraged to observe and memorize details, and it's during these focused moments that horror elements appear.
- This forces players to face fear directly rather than avoiding it—unlike most horror games.

---

### Threat, Not Just Fear

- Emphasis was placed on **sustained threat and sensory discomfort**, not just surprise or tension.
- The game keeps players on edge through **continuous psychological pressure**.

---

### Narrative & Visual Identity

- The narrative was strengthened with unexpected **twists** and surreal elements, such as:
  - Transparent skin
  - Hair growing from a character’s mouth
- These visuals evoke the **uncanny valley**, enhancing horror beyond typical jump scares.
- One character, *Bori*, was cited by the developer as a personal favorite.
