title: Hello, I'm HaeSoo.
---

I’m a Game Developer and Creative Director with 3+ years of experience in Unreal Engine (C++/Blueprint). I build games that deliver what players actually want—experiences that feel intuitive, immersive, and technically solid.

I led the development of Who’s at the Door? (2025), a single-player psychological horror game released on Steam. As the sole developer, I directed the game from concept to launch—covering gameplay programming, narrative scripting, anomaly detection logic, localization, publishing, and community engagement. The game sold 30,000+ copies in its first week and was featured on Steam’s Top Sellers list.

I also contributed to:
- Strike Rush (2023–2024): A competitive VR multiplayer FPS where I developed bot AI for PvP-style matches and designed mission-based singleplayer stages.
- I Can’t Handle My Body (2024): A short 3D platformer jam game released on Steam. I led the project as Team Leader and Lead Programmer.
- Clash Row (2022–2023): Mobile territory-based strategy game with PvP. Built with Unity & C#.

- My technical toolkit includes:
- Advanced AI systems: Utility AI, Behavior Trees, FSM
- Mission scripting, save/load, game state handling
- UI/UX programming and gameplay camera systems
- Multiplayer and VR development (client-server, replication)
- Primary tools: Unreal Engine 5, C++, Blueprint

I thrive in cross-disciplinary teams, balancing creative ideas with production feasibility, and always designing with player experience at the core.
